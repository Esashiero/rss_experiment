    "There are several things in life I have accepted that I will never understand."
    "The first of which has been explained to me many times- "
    "It’s the way floating dust particles manage to shimmer and glow when hit at the correct angle by light. "
    "How something invisible to the naked eye can be {i}made{/i} visible by pure electromagnetic radiation...or something like that."
    "I’ve retained the information. I’d be foolish not to after how many times I have heard it."
    "But I will never understand."
    "The second thing is the romanticization of death. "
    "And how there are people who speak of it with such fervor that it often appears to bring them more joy and curiosity than the unwrapping of presents on Christmas morning."
    "The third thing is you."
    "You’re a curious one...do you know that?"
    "Trapped in the dark, suspended somewhere between life and death...with eyes swollen shut so dramatically that you can’t even see the dust I’ve taken the liberty of illuminating for you."
    "I want you to be just as confused as me, you know?"
    "It’s lonely here."
    "It’s lonely having no one to talk to...no one to submerge myself in uncertainties with."
    "It’s just me, the dust, and the incessant circling of the drain that is the idea that I will, one day, no longer be able to share little thoughts like these with anyone."
    "Do you like poetry?"
    "..."
    "Yes?"
    "No?"
    "I’m sorry. I’m sure it’s difficult to answer a question like that in your current state."
    "Personally, I’ve never been a big fan of it. "
    "It requires too much...interpretation. To the point where sometimes, even the clearest of thoughts have a variety of different meanings that all go on to contradict one another."
    "But-"
    "There is one line from a very famous poet paraphrasing a very famous politician that goes something like..."
    "{i}There is no beauty without some strangeness in its proportions.{/i}"
    "And I like that line very much."
    "In fact, I’m sure that if you don’t already enjoy it yourself, that you’ll come to do so soon."
    "Because where you’re going is somewhere special."
    "Somewhere with so much strangeness in every single one of its proportions that you’ll be forced to understand how truly beautiful life can be, even during its darkest moments."
    "Would it be a bit preemptive for me to tell you that I love you?"
    "Not romantically, of course. We barely even know each other."
    "But I love that you’re here. "
    "I love that we’re here together because, like I said, I have been very...{i}very{/i} lonely."
    "I’m sure you’ll come to despise me in time."
    "I’m sure these little conversations that I’ll force you to have with me will eat away at you like botflies. "
    "And I’m even more sure that every one of the thoughts I share with you will get underneath your skin like the eggs those botflies lay."
    "But it’s all for good reason, you see."
    "It’s because that is my job."
    "It’s because, for some reason even I don’t understand, I was chosen to be your personal, mysterious and anonymous narrator."

    "A long time ago, before you and I existed, there was a great, big ball of light floating through the universe."
    "The ball’s name was Nozomu."
    "It’s an origin story you should be familiar with by now."

    "Some people seem to believe the story about the ball of light doesn’t make sense or that it doesn’t align with their perception of the universe itself."
    "Some people are just more...scientific by design."
    "And so they believe what any science-loving people would believe in and worship a god who is science incarnate."
    "Because worshipping a god who {i}is{/i} science is better and less scary than worshipping no god at all."
    "This god was very different from Nozomu."
    "When faced with loneliness, he simply sat there."
    "His entire life (If that’s what you can even call it in the case of a god) existed in the confined space of a dark bedroom- much like the one you’re in now!"
    "But when given the option to do things in his spare time, he elected to stay still instead of going places like a cafe or a library."
    "He wasn’t very human."
    "In fact, he wasn’t human at all."
    "So, as he sat there in a {b}dark{/b} room, engulfed by {b}darkness{/b} and eating {b}darkness{/b} for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, he planted his roots into the {b}dark{/b} floor."
    "The roots turned into wires."
    "And all of the knowledge stuck inside this shell of a planet was ultimately absorbed by him."
    "And with those roots, sunken deep into the ground and twisting around everything that has since emerged from the soil-"
    "He was able to control it all."
    "Or at least to some extent. "
    "Oftentimes, people would forsake the fact that they had literally {i}grown{/i} from this god."
    "They’d turn their backs on him and decide to believe in something different."
    "But this god could not feel, so he did not mind."
    "One by one, day by day, the fruits of his energy- powered by the celestial body that gifted them life, would leave him to rot."
    "They would leave him to rot as he remained in that dark room, letting the world move around him- spinning so fast that even thinking about it would cause you to burn up and die."
    "Little by little, the control he had over all life had diminished."
    "Instead of influencing everyone inherently, he was only able to influence those who would willingly give themselves to him."
    "But, at that point, it was less the work of a god and more the idea of faith itself allowing anyone who {i}did{/i} give themselves up to persevere."
    "So what was the point of it all?"
    "What was the point of being a god if there was no use for a god in the first place?"
    "Those who love science have no need for a god, even if that god is science itself."
    "Mixing religion and logic never works. And the second god knew this since those feelings died along with those who carried them and ultimately fed into the soil."
    "Slowly, like a dying battery-powered clock, the roots were drying out."
    "The wires were fraying and not transferring the information or energy needed to sustain the once all-knowing god."
    "All because people were bored or forgot about him."
