    "There are several things in life I have accepted that I will never understand."
    "The first of which has been explained to me many times- "
    "It’s the way floating dust particles manage to shimmer and glow when hit at the correct angle by light. "
    "How something invisible to the naked eye can be {i}made{/i} visible by pure electromagnetic radiation...or something like that."
    "I’ve retained the information. I’d be foolish not to after how many times I have heard it."
    "But I will never understand."
    "The second thing is the romanticization of death. "
    "And how there are people who speak of it with such fervor that it often appears to bring them more joy and curiosity than the unwrapping of presents on Christmas morning."
    "The third thing is you."
    "You’re a curious one...do you know that?"
    "Trapped in the dark, suspended somewhere between life and death...with eyes swollen shut so dramatically that you can’t even see the dust I’ve taken the liberty of illuminating for you."
    "I want you to be just as confused as me, you know?"
    "It’s lonely here."
    "It’s lonely having no one to talk to...no one to submerge myself in uncertainties with."
    "It’s just me, the dust, and the incessant circling of the drain that is the idea that I will, one day, no longer be able to share little thoughts like these with anyone."
    "Do you like poetry?"
    "..."
    "Yes?"
    "No?"
    "I’m sorry. I’m sure it’s difficult to answer a question like that in your current state."
    "Personally, I’ve never been a big fan of it. "
    "It requires too much...interpretation. To the point where sometimes, even the clearest of thoughts have a variety of different meanings that all go on to contradict one another."
    "But-"
    "There is one line from a very famous poet paraphrasing a very famous politician that goes something like..."
    "{i}There is no beauty without some strangeness in its proportions.{/i}"
    "And I like that line very much."
    "In fact, I’m sure that if you don’t already enjoy it yourself, that you’ll come to do so soon."
    "Because where you’re going is somewhere special."
    "Somewhere with so much strangeness in every single one of its proportions that you’ll be forced to understand how truly beautiful life can be, even during its darkest moments."
    "Would it be a bit preemptive for me to tell you that I love you?"
    "Not romantically, of course. We barely even know each other."
    "But I love that you’re here. "
    "I love that we’re here together because, like I said, I have been very...{i}very{/i} lonely."
    "I’m sure you’ll come to despise me in time."
    "I’m sure these little conversations that I’ll force you to have with me will eat away at you like botflies. "
    "And I’m even more sure that every one of the thoughts I share with you will get underneath your skin like the eggs those botflies lay."
    "But it’s all for good reason, you see."
    "It’s because that is my job."
    "It’s because, for some reason even I don’t understand, I was chosen to be your personal, mysterious and anonymous narrator."
