    },
    {
      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "I know. It\u2019s a direct result of the combination of REM sleep with the flood of adrenaline that comes from being inserted into a stressful or terrifying situation."

      "character": "Sensei",

      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "The dream is not just of the sky itself but of me as I swim through it."
    },
    {
      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "The only issue is, you can\u2019t swim through the sky. And so logic dictates that I would have to be falling."
    },

      "character": "Sensei",
      "text": "Or flying, since it\u2019s a dream and logic doesn\u2019t influence dreams."
    },

      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "To say it doesn\u2019t influence them is a bit of a reach, don\u2019t you think?"
    },
    {
      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "Pretty much everything we see is tied to logic in one way or another. Things very rarely happen without reason."
    },
    {
      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "And so, as someone who spends far too much time bathing in this aspect of human thought, it\u2019s easy for me to understand what\u2019s happening in those dreams of mine."

      "text": "My own shadow, I suppose."
    },

      "character": "Makoto",

    },

      "character": "Sensei",
      "text": "That...definitely sounds a little worse than what my apparent shadow makes me do."
    },
    {
      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "Worse, sure. But I\u2019m stronger than you and would never let something like that overtake me the same way you let {i}yours{/i} overtake {i}you{/i}."
    },

    },

      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "I\u2019m smart. I have a bright future ahead of me. I have a wonderful best friend. And I like to think I\u2019m at least decently attractive."

    },

      "character": "Sensei",
      "text": "Well, yeah. But also because it\u2019s true."
    },
    {
      "character": "Sensei",
      "text": "But why spend time thinking about all of those things when, comparatively, your situation isn\u2019t all that bad?"
    },

      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "I\u2019ve explained something like that to you in the past, haven\u2019t I?"

      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "What was my reasoning back then?"
    },

    },

      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "Then that\u2019s my reasoning this time, too."

      "text": "Not everyone has complete control over their emotions the way you do, Sensei."

    },
    {
      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "But the amount of effort I put into hiding that part of me really only makes me more tired at the end of the day."
    },
    {
      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "Mix that with an onslaught of dreams that feel more like memories of horrible things and you have one unhappy Makoto."
    },
    {
      "character": "Makoto",
      "text": "And, it might not always work, but the best medicine for an unhappy Makoto is someone who can constantly remind her that her troubles are nothing but troubles."
    },
    {
      "character": "Makoto",

    },
    {
      "character": "Makoto",
