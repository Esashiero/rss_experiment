    "There are over nineteen different ways to brew coffee."
    "I will now tell you about them."
    "The first is the espresso machine."
    "Anyone who knows anything about coffee knows what an espresso machine is – they’ve been keeping us caffeinated since 1901."
    "Today they come in various shapes and sizes, with loads of features and gimmicks. "
    "Don’t get confused by flash machines though because the basics are the same. "
    "Pressurized water is pushed through a chamber/puck of finely ground coffee beans, through a filter, resulting in what we call a shot of espresso. "
    "Don’t have a few hundred bucks to spend on an espresso machine, but still looking for that espresso-shot-like-kick that comes from a pressurized brew? The Moka-Pot is the next best thing."
    "The magic behind the Moka pot is in its 3 chambered brew process. Water in the bottom chamber boils, and the steam causes pressure that pushes water up through the coffee grounds into the top chamber.​ "
    "The AeroPress has a cult following among the traveling coffee community, and it looks more like a science project rather than a coffee brewer. "
    "But, if you ask me, it’s the best thing that has ever happened to coffee. And many people say it brews the best coffee they’ve ever tasted. "
    "The French press is the unofficial mascot of home brewed coffee."
    "It’s been steeping coffee in households since before your grandparents were born, and it has a very loyal, cult following among the home barista community. "
    "But why?"
    "It’s likely thanks to multiple reasons, but our money is on the fact that its super easy to use, can be picked up for pocket change (almost) and produces a brew with a distinct taste and feel like no other method. "
    "A relatively new invention (est. 2010) the SoftBrew has been dubbed ‘primitive yet high tech’. "
    "I’m not sure what the fuck that means, but if I were to describe the SoftBrew in simple terms, I would say “it’s like a French press, but easier.” "
    "The idea of instant coffee is great – it comes in a small jar so you can take it anywhere. Just add hot water."
    "There’s just one major problem — it fucking blows. So we’re not gonna talk about that one."
    "Making coffee with a siphon pot is unique as it comes."
    "It’s a combination of brewing methods: a full immersion brew (as your coffee goes into the water) but also uses siphon action to create a great tasting cup. "
    "It’s not a simple way to brew coffee, in fact, it requires an enormous amount of effort and process, so you won’t want to use it daily (unless you’ve got nothing else to do). "
    "The percolator is nothing new or cutting edge in the world of coffee. If you’ve been to a bland looking diner somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, chances are you’ve drunk percolated coffee. "
    "Rumor has it that there are people out there who actually enjoy percolated coffee, but the person who told me that was also trapped inside a jar of peanut butter."
    "The next method is the Chemex brewer, which looks like a weird vase."
    "The primary benefit of using a Chemex over other drippers is capacity."
    "You can easily make 3 or 4 cups in one go, rather than 1 or 2, meaning it’s a crowd pleaser when your homies are around."
    "In fact, you can buy a 10-cup Chemex Vase that takes 50 ounces of water. It’s an entertainer’s best friend. "
    "Sometimes, I masturbate in front of the window in hopes that someone will see me."
    "I’ll be honest: when I first got my V60 dripper I didn’t have too much faith in it – it just seemed so simple compared to other pour over coffee brewing systems. That week I learned never to make assumptions."
    "The Hario v60 is a simple yet brilliant way to brew coffee – its small and light, meaning you can take it just about anywhere, and it makes a damn good cup of Joseph."
    "The Kalita Wave Dripper is the arch-enemy of the Hario V60 – and it’s giving the V60 a good run for its money. "
    "Like the V60, the Kalita Wave involves a simple cone shaped dripping system, however, its flat-bed (as opposed to the v60’s conical shape) means longer dwell times and less room for error. "
    "The Vietnamese dripper (also called a ‘Phin’) is a single cup dripper that takes 4-5 minutes to brew, meaning it’s the perfect accomplice for solo coffee drinkers who want more time to party."
    "Unlike some of the above drippers, this method of brewing does not call for much skill or fancy pouring style. It’s about as easy as they come; just pour in your water and wait. "
    "The Melitta Ready Set Joe dripper is the most convenient option on the market – perfect for camping fanatics who still love a decent cup of Joseph."
    "It’s a simple plastic dripping cone that brews coffee in a flash. "
    "You won’t get the same quality brew that you’ll get with other drippers, however, its price tag and portability means it’s a favorite among campers and travelers.​ "
    "The Bee House is a Japanese pour over brewer that is getting a great deal of attention in the coffee world – likely because it’s easy to use and looks really sexy."
    "It’s worth mentioning that the learning curve is more forgiving than the Hario V60 or the Kalita Wave, meaning it’s a great way to get your feet wet in the world of pour over coffee. "
    "Tsuneyo sure is taking a long time out there."
    "The Clever Dripper looks like just any other pour over dripper, but on closer inspection you’ll notice that the Clever Dripper is a cross between a steeping and pour over brewer. "
    "What sets this lil’ dude apart from the rest of the dripper family is its clever little valve that stops your brew draining into your cup/vessel until you activate it. "
    "If you haven’t heard of cold drip coffee you must be a fucking idiot. That or you’ve been hiding under a rock for the past few years. "
    "Cold brew is one of the most popular caffeine infused innovations of our time – and no, we are not talking about iced coffee. "
    "In a nutshell, it’s made by slowly dripping cold filtered water through your fresh grinds for a long period – often 10 hours or more. Enough time to kidnap someone or repair a section of a broken fence."
    "Derived from cold brew coffee, nitro coffee is the newest kid on the block in the coffee world, and you can expect to hear a lot more about it in the future."
    "As the name suggests, it's cold brewed coffee, pumped full of nitrogen, which affects the taste and the texture in a very, very nice way. "
    "The result is similar to a cold brew coffee but crisper, a little sweeter and it looks like a pint of Guinness — a beverage that does not exist in Kumon-mi since we are blocked off from the rest of the world."
    "Aren’t you excited to know so much about coffee now?"
    "Let's learn some more."
    "Cowboy coffee is the oldest known method of brewing coffee."
    "It’s outdated, but it works, and you don’t need much to make it happen. "
    "Commonly used around campsites where nobody has bothered to pack any coffee making gear, all you’ll need is a flame and a saucepan. "
    "In a nutshell: fill your pot with water, bring it to a boil, throw in your ground coffee, remove it from the heat and let it brew for a few minutes. "
    "Once the grounds settle to the bottom of the pot, you can pour your coffee into your mug, slowly and gently. Nothing fancy required. "
    "From 1299, the Ottoman Empire ruled Turkey for an impressively long stint, and strong Turkish coffee played a significant role in fueling their endurance. "
    "There’s a very good chance that I made up that last fact, however, you can be sure that (A) Turkish coffee packs a punch, and (B) It’s been enjoyed around the world for a very long time."
    "Brewing Turkish coffee seems easy, but with like most brew methods, there’s skill in doing it right. Learn the skills by reading a guide or something."
    "The most common way involves a Turkish coffee pot, water and very finely ground coffee beans. "
    "You’ll simmer the brew a number of times (2-3 times) and end up with a brew that you’ll love or hate: strong but exceptional tasting with a thick foam on top. "
    "Congratulations. Now you are the coffee expert."

    "The light nourished the seed. Then it grew into some other thing and another thing showed up and then more stuff happened and here we are."

    "We’re fragile things, you and me. "
    "I may not look the part, but I am no more or less mortal than you."

    "And it’s scary enough going outside knowing that this mistake does not even have to rest in {i}your{/i} hands...and that your life could be cut short by someone {i}else{/i} tripping over their own eight feet. "
    "How terribly unfair is that?"
    "Why would anyone ever go outside in the first place knowing everything they think and feel could come crashing down at any moment?"
    "It all gets more complicated when you realize that simply isolating yourself won’t help either."
    "Time moves in both ways."
    "There are things happening in every direction, and every single one of them could impact where you’ll be tomorrow and who you’ll see the next time you open your eyes."
    "Which is why we should cherish the dark."
    "For if there is no light, and there is no seed — there would have never been a you or me."
    "Our fragile timeline would snap like an old bridge and everyone we know, currently trapped between the wooden stakes holding it up labeled {i}past{/i} and {i}future{/i}, would plummet to their deaths."
    "But that’s just a metaphor."
    "It would be more like never existing in the first place."
    "We’d feel no pain as we’d have never developed the ability to feel it."
    "There would be no lingering regret of a future unexplored because we’d never be ordained to explore it at all."
    "We’d just be energy, or a lack thereof — waiting for whatever we’re supposed to cite as the creator to just press the start button so we can begin our long and painful journey."
    "In a sense..."
    "That makes you a bit of a god too, doesn’t it?"
    "What if we’re {i}all{/i} gods? Packed to the gills with divine blood and celestial plasma- all simultaneously pressing “Start” but spawning in different locations at different stages in life."

    "{i}Step one: Pay close attention to everything everyone says — because you never know when someone might be foreshadowing something!{/i}"
    "{i}Step two: Ignore step one and come up with your own abstract idea for the story {b}you{/b} want to read. Then, disregard any information that does not support it as unreliable narration.{/i}"
    "{i}Step three: Grind affection and lust points to use as currency for future sex scenes. Just not too many of them because you might eventually be punished for it!{/i}"
    "{i}Step four: Accept that you might eventually be punished for things you didn’t even realize you were doing incorrectly because life is unfair and mean and everything should be about you all the time.{/i}"
    "{i}Step five: Everything is always about you. All the time. Always.{/i}"
    "{i}Step six: Reinforce that belief! As hard as you can! Everything revolves around you! You are the best!{/i}"
    "{i}Step seven: Forget step two, then remember step one. Grind your ideas into dust and sprinkle them throughout the three halves of the city so that there are little bits and pieces of them in everything.{/i}"
    "{i}Step eight: See the world through someone else’s eyes. Taste the dust of your thoughts for the very first time with the tongues of other unknowing creatures.{/i}"
    "{i}Step nine: Forget steps five and six. Remember step four. Then contemplate giving up altogether because none of this makes any sense. Proceed to the tenth step.{/i}"
