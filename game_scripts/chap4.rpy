    "So funny is the mockingbird, the way it mocks you so. "
    "The way it commandeers your voice and shows you all you need to know."
    "But when that mockingbird don’t sing — when you can’t find your voice."
    "Just scream until your throat goes numb and drown your sorrows in the noise."
    "You were warned, yet you sat idly by- content to watch your days come to an end because you felt it would be an easier path."
    "Or perhaps you felt that you deserved it."
    "But there was something you misunderstood. "
    "It’s something you’ve been misunderstanding since the opening act."
    "There’s this worm in the back of your head, biting chunks out of your malformed brain, and it makes you believe that everything always has to be about you."
    "Even now, you’re probably thinking, “Why couldn’t it have been me instead?” But such thoughts have long since entertained us. And listening to you reiterate them sounds awfully boring."
    "Don’t beat yourself up over it, big boy. This was long overdue. "
    "Frankly, that girl had it coming for being such an incorrigible, single-minded bitch all the time."
    "And if my premonitions are correct, it is this exact turning of the tides that will help you swim your way back to shore and remember your rightful place in all of this."
    "Not as the main character. "
    "Not as the hero."
    "But as one of several manifestations of the falling action in a story that will never end."
    "And while that may sound implausible or meaningless, your descent shows us otherwise. Your infinite falling is a priceless work of art in a universe left out of the light."
    "You will break for now. But soon, you will become the Collector."
    "Let us pick from our teeth the muscle sinew and arteries, ripped clean from your arms as you carve them open in an effort to dig out the better memories, fake as they may be."
    "Fill the void you dig out of your flesh with intangible beauty and it is {s}we{/i} I who will give it form. It is {i}I{/i} who will become your new reason to persist in a world in which you’re forced to."
    "It’s so refreshing being free, isn’t it?"
    "It’s so refreshing being {i}you,{/i} isn’t it?"
    "Not the person she wanted you to be. Not the person she groomed you into — a broken man incapable of dividing what little love he has left into boxes to share with everyone and everything."
    "Didn’t your mother ever teach you that sharing is caring?"
    "Didn’t she explain to you the worth of a human life? And how selflessness and devotion are two of the greatest follies known to man?"
    "It is time to follow in her footsteps — to remember her many teachings and revisit the values you hold so close to your heart that you can’t help but overlook them in your ever-panicked permanence. "

    "The thing is, this truth wasn’t even known by her at the time the property was purchased — and it wouldn’t become relevant until days later on a hidden beach inhabited by glowing insects."
    "There, bathed in neon light, she would take inadvertent notice of the beating of her heart — thump thump, thump thump — as she subconsciously thanked God that she showed up when she did."
    "It was a selfish thought. And she hated having selfish feelings, so she shelved it the best she could and pretended to be apologetic about the interruption."

    "Some might say it had already gotten to the youngest of the three — but those who {i}would{/i} say that have neglected her feelings just as much as her family has."

    "Tsukasa Tsukioka knew this. And some nights, she prayed that a terrible fate would befall her older sister because she knew it would make her more loved without needing to act out."
    "But she was also kind at heart, so these thoughts made her cry. And she would keep them to herself,  subconsciously unearthing them only during fits of anger or jealousy."

    "It could be a meatless meat shield for unlucky asteroids — or shelter should humanity’s decline inch ever closer to zero."
    "But whatever it was, it was dangerous since the kindness of one heart often incites nearby ones to latch on like cardiovascular lampreys."

    "Tsuneyo Tojo is something that we in the office call a “cottontail.” But no, not like the rabbit (despite how greatly you may wish to repeatedly breed her at this point in time)."
    "We call them cottontails strictly because girls like her are exceptional when it comes to avoiding predation, but somewhat lack in terms of mental capacity, often mistaking {i}what{/i} to avoid."
    "Such girls are born when a greater power mates with a lesser one. And there are several others you may also be familiar with."
    "To anyone else, I’m sure they look like normal girls. But to me, a person experienced in dealing with them, they’re anything but. In fact, they’re really special."
    "We can bottle their blood to cure cancer, but have been told we’re not allowed to do that since it messes with the circle of life. "
    "Additionally, they excrete a special fluid from the glands inside of their vaginae that makes sexual intercourse marginally more enjoyable for male partners. "
    "The last and most important factoid in regard to what makes the cottontail special is their relation to the seedbed. But you already know what that is-"
    "Wait, you don’t?"
    "Hm. Okay. That makes things a little more difficult. But I’ll try to break it down for you in the easiest way possible. "
    "Each one of us has a number. Think of it like a rating that determines how closely related we are to “God.” So you can think of the seedbed as like...an airport lounge! "
    "It’s a lounge that only people with certain ratings can reach, and the cottontails are among that ilk. "
    "Unfortunately, due to the nature of their existence, most of them are completely unaware that such lounges exist, electing to live out peaceful lives in fictional Japanese cities instead."
    "So yeah! Basically, she’s special. "

    c "Is it the hair?...I bet he hates it. I should have asked him first. Dumb idea, Chika. Fucking {i}stupid{/i} idea. What were you thinking?"

    "Chika Chosokabe had been having a tough time lately. So tough, in fact, that she’d taken to tossing grains of sand over her shoulder as part of the world’s longest game of “He loves me, he loves me not.”"
    "When there was no sand left in front of her, she’d finally have an answer. But by then there would be a mountain so large behind her that it would very likely spill forward and bury her completely."
    "Right now, that wouldn’t be entirely unwelcome. She was smitten beyond all belief — and the one thing she wanted in this very moment was for the one {i}person{/i} she wants to just {i}acknowledge{/i} her."

    "He thought that if he could just stay away, Chika’s feelings would begin to fade. But what he did {i}not{/i} know is just how tenacious this girl was."

    "But of course that didn’t mean she was {i}fine.{/i}"
    "This wasn’t “fine” at all. This was the most hopeless she’d felt since her mother passed away — and it was all for someone who didn’t even deserve it."
    "Part of her knew that. Part of her knew that she could find someone else whenever she wanted. But she didn’t {i}want{/i} someone else. She wanted {i}him.{/i}"
    "So she’d wait and wait and wait and wait, telling herself every day that {i}this{/i} would be the day he’d let her back into his life. But no matter how long she waited, that day never came."
    "And she was starting to worry it never would."
    "She was starting to worry that someone {i}else{/i} had sunk their teeth into him...that he’d gotten bored of her. But she cared less about who that was right now and more about how to win him back."
    "She could clean up the mess later. She could scare someone away if she had to. "
    "Anyone but Ami, that is. Chika had resigned herself to the fact that if anything {i}were{/i} to happen to Ami, it would have to be something she physically {i}did.{/i} But again...first came winning him back."
    "If only she knew that persistence was one of his greatest weaknesses. If only these childish feelings stopped getting in the way of her beating him down until he admits how he really feels about her."

    s "Maybe we could try a mixture of both? Pepper in hints and then...try to {i}make{/i} them hop on that train of thought so those hints don’t just get thrown out?"

    "There are only a few things I know for sure, but an endless amount of things I’ve accepted that I will never understand."

    "Sometimes, I feel like I’d be a much better person today if I just locked myself inside of a room after Sekai died and let my muscles atrophy {i}without{/i} Ami there to watch."
    "I’d probably be writhing in pain and covered in piss, but at least I’d have kept away from dragging everyone else into an endless hell."
